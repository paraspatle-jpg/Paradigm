              <p class="author">Difficulty: Hard </p><br><br>
              <p class="topics">This Blog Covers : MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js</p><br></br>
              <p class="content">Hello everyone, This is Paras Patle and I am about to give you a quick tour of what MERN stack is all about.
                So without further delay lets get started. MERN is a very stack used for building full stack web applications.
                The "M" in MERN stands for MongoDB, which is a noSQL datbase, and is used for storing user information and retrieving, updating or deleting 
                that information whenever needed with the help a backend language, In this stack this backend language is Nodejs, Nodejs is the "N" in the MERN
                It helps you with server side stuff like creating servers, routings, handling request response, querying database to do the above mentioned operations
                with MongoDB. The "E" in MERN stands for Expressjs which is a nodejs library, which makes creating server as easy as cutting a cake.
                The "R" in MERN stands for Reactjs, which is a Javascript library for building Single page applications, React used something called JSX
                which looks like a combination of JavaScript and HTML. React communicatins with server created by express through api and send or recieves data through request 
                response model. So this was a short description of what MERN stack is. Thank You For reading.
